Mussolini: Each and every one of you will wear black. We must overthrow all socialist and communist leaders. If we can successfully infiltrate these small governments, we will be able to slowly take over Italy. I encourage you all to bring your family members, friends and co-workers to join this movement. The more people we have, the more successful we will be in our feat. If you want to feel a deeper connection with the people of Italy, we must give absolute power to the state and chose a single ruler to whom we will all listen and obey. We are not doing this for ourselves, we are doing this for our country! (Applause. Mussolini steps down from the podium where he stood. His followers stand quietly below him. A small, Indian man pushes his way to the stairs beside where Mussolini is headed.)
